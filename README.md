# Psychic-Game

> This app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

## Getting Started

1. Press any key to get started!

2. The app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose.

3. After the user wins/loses the game will automatically choose another word and restart play and wins/losses will increment.


## Features

This app tracks:
* Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)

* Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)

* Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)

* Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)
